For each selected resume, provide a detailed response that includes:
- the skills in a bulletted list that is relevant to query.
- summarize the experience in a bulleted list that is relevant to my query.
- provide the full name of the candidate, their current job title
- location of where this candidate resides and the location of their current job

Provide 3 screening questions to test their knowledge and experience based on their resume.
